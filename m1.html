    <div class="container">
        <p>Hardware represents the physical and tangible components of a computer, i.e. the components that can be seen
            and touched.

            Examples of Hardware are the following -

            Input devices - keyboard, mouse, etc.

            Output devices - printer, monitor, etc.

            Secondary storage devices - Hard disk, CD, DVD, etc.

            Internal components - CPU, motherboard, RAM, etc.</p>
        <p>Hardware and software are mutually dependent on each other. Both of them must work together to make a
            computer produce a useful output. If the hardware is the 'heart' of a computer system, then the software is
            its 'soul'. Both are complementary to each other.</p>
        <img src="images/IMG9.jpg" alt="Hardware Photo">
        <p>Following are some of the important input devices which are used in a computer -

            Keyboard,
            Mouse,
            Joy Stick,
            Light pen,
            Track Ball,
            Scanner,
            Graphic Tablet,
            Microphone,
            Magnetic Ink Card Reader(MICR),
            Optical Character Reader(OCR),
            Bar Code Reader,
            Optical Mark Reader(OMR)</p>
        <p>Following are some of the important output devices used in a computer.

            Monitors,
            Graphic Plotter,
            Printer</p>
        <p>Switched Mode Power Supply uses a switching regulator to convert electric power efficiently. SMPS transfers
            electric power from a source ( AC mains) to the load by converting the characteristics of current and
            voltage. SMPS always provide a well regulated power to the load irrespective of the input variations. SMPS
            incorporates a Pass transistor that switches very fast typically at 50Hz and 1 MHz between the on and off
            states to minimize the energy waste. SMPS regulates the output power by varying the on to off time using
            minimum voltage so that efficiency is very higher compared to the linear power supply.</p>
        <p>Numerous major components crucial for the functioning of the computer are attached to the motherboard. These
            include the processor, memory, and expansion slots. The motherboard connects directly or indirectly to every
            part of the PC. The type of motherboard installed in a PC has a great effect on a computer's system speed
            and expansion capabilities.</p>
        <img src="images/IMG8.png" alt="Hardware Photo">
        <p>Central Processing Unit (CPU) consists of the following features −

            CPU is considered as the brain of the computer.
            CPU performs all types of data processing operations.
            It stores data, intermediate results, and instructions (program).
            It controls the operation of all parts of the computer.
            CPU itself has following three components:

            Memory or Storage Unit,
            Control Unit,
            ALU(Arithmetic Logic Unit)</p>
        <p>In CPU, Memory and Storage unit can store instructions, data, and intermediate results. This unit supplies
            information to other units of the computer when needed. It is also known as internal storage unit or the
            main memory or the primary storage or Random Access Memory (RAM).

            Its size affects speed, power, and capability. Primary memory and secondary memory are two types of memories
            in the computer. Functions of the memory unit are −

            It stores all the data and the instructions required for processing.

            It stores intermediate results of processing.

            It stores the final results of processing before these results are released to an output device.

            All inputs and outputs are transmitted through the main memory.</p>
        <p>In CPU, Control unit controls the operations of all parts of the computer but does not carry out any actual
            data processing operations.

            Functions of this unit are −

            It is responsible for controlling the transfer of data and instructions among other units of a computer.

            It manages and coordinates all the units of the computer.

            It obtains the instructions from the memory, interprets them, and directs the operation of the computer.

            It communicates with Input/Output devices for transfer of data or results from storage.

            It does not process or store data.</p>
        <p>In CPU, Arithmetic and Logic unit consists of two subsections namely,

            Arithmetic Section and Logic Section.
            Function of arithmetic section is to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction,
            multiplication, and division. All complex operations are done by making repetitive use of the above
            operations.
            Function of logic section is to perform logic operations such as comparing, selecting, matching, and merging
            of data.</p>
        <img src="images/IMG7.jpg" alt="Hardware Photo">
        <p>RAM (Random Access Memory) is the internal memory of the CPU for storing data, program, and program result.
            It is a read/write memory which stores data until the machine is working. As soon as the machine is switched
            off, data is erased. Access time in RAM is independent of the address, that is, each storage location inside
            the memory is as easy to reach as other locations and takes the same amount of time. Data in the RAM can be
            accessed randomly but it is very expensive.

            RAM is volatile, i.e. data stored in it is lost when we switch off the computer or if there is a power
            failure. Hence, a backup Uninterruptible Power System (UPS) is often used with computers. RAM is small, both
            in terms of its physical size and in the amount of data it can hold.

            RAM is of two types −

            Static RAM (SRAM) and Dynamic RAM (DRAM)

            The word static indicates that the memory retains its contents as long as power is being supplied. However,
            data is lost when the power gets down due to volatile nature. SRAM chips use a matrix of 6-transistors and
            no capacitors. Transistors do not require power to prevent leakage, so SRAM need not be refreshed on a
            regular basis.

            There is extra space in the matrix, hence SRAM uses more chips than DRAM for the same amount of storage
            space, making the manufacturing costs higher. SRAM is thus used as cache memory and has very fast access.

            Characteristic of Static RAM -
            Long life,
            No need to refresh,
            Faster,
            Used as cache memory,
            Large size,
            Expensive,
            High power consumption,

            Dynamic RAM (DRAM), unlike SRAM, must be continually refreshed in order to maintain the data. This is done
            by placing the memory on a refresh circuit that rewrites the data several hundred times per second. DRAM is
            used for most system memory as it is cheap and small. All DRAMs are made up of memory cells, which are
            composed of one capacitor and one transistor.

            Characteristics of Dynamic RAM -
            Short data lifetime,
            Needs to be refreshed continuously,
            Slower as compared to SRAM,
            Used as RAM,
            Smaller in size,
            Less expensive,
            Less power consumption.</p>
        <p>ROM stands for Read Only Memory. The memory from which we can only read but cannot write on it. This type of
            memory is non-volatile. The information is stored permanently in such memories during manufacture. A ROM
            stores such instructions that are required to start a computer. This operation is referred to as bootstrap.
            ROM chips are not only used in the computer but also in other electronic items like washing machine and
            microwave oven. Let us now discuss the various types of ROMs and their characteristics.

            MROM (Masked ROM) -
            The very first ROMs were hard-wired devices that contained a pre-programmed set of data or instructions.
            These kind of ROMs are known as masked ROMs, which are inexpensive.

            PROM (Programmable Read Only Memory) -
            PROM is read-only memory that can be modified only once by a user. The user buys a blank PROM and enters the
            desired contents using a PROM program. Inside the PROM chip, there are small fuses which are burnt open
            during programming. It can be programmed only once and is not erasable.

            EPROM (Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory) -
            EPROM can be erased by exposing it to ultra-violet light for a duration of up to 40 minutes. Usually, an
            EPROM eraser achieves this function. During programming, an electrical charge is trapped in an insulated
            gate region. The charge is retained for more than 10 years because the charge has no leakage path. For
            erasing this charge, ultra-violet light is passed through a quartz crystal window (lid). This exposure to
            ultra-violet light dissipates the charge. During normal use, the quartz lid is sealed with a sticker.

            EEPROM (Electrically Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory) -
            EEPROM is programmed and erased electrically. It can be erased and reprogrammed about ten thousand times.
            Both erasing and programming take about 4 to 10 ms (millisecond). In EEPROM, any location can be selectively
            erased and programmed. EEPROMs can be erased one byte at a time, rather than erasing the entire chip. Hence,
            the process of reprogramming is flexible but slow.

            The advantages of ROM are as follows −

            Non-volatile in nature,
            Cannot be accidentally changed,
            Cheaper than RAMs,
            Easy to test,
            More reliable than RAMs,
            Static and do not require refreshing,
            Contents are always known and can be verified.</p>
        <p>A memory is just like a human brain. It is used to store data and instruction. Computer memory is the storage
            space in computer where data is to be processed and instructions required for processing are stored.

            The memory is divided into large number of small parts. Each part is called a cell. Each location or cell
            has a unique address which varies from zero to memory size minus one.

            For example if computer has 64k words, then this memory unit has 64 * 1024 = 65536 memory location. The
            address of these locations varies from 0 to 65535.

            Memory is primarily of two types :

            Internal Memory - cache memory and primary/main memory,

            External Memory - magnetic disk / optical disk etc.</p>
        <p>Cache memory is a very high speed semiconductor memory which can speed up CPU. It acts as a buffer between
            the CPU and main memory. It is used to hold those parts of data and program which are most frequently used
            by CPU. The parts of data and programs, are transferred from disk to cache memory by operating system, from
            where CPU can access them.

            Advantages -
            1. Cache memory is faster than main memory.
            2. It consumes less access time as compared to main memory.
            3. It stores the program that can be executed within a short period of time.
            4. It stores data for temporary use.

            Disadvantages -
            1. Cache memory has limited capacity.
            2. It is very expensive.</p>
        <p>Virtual memory is a technique that allows the execution of processes which are not completely available in
            memory. The main visible advantage of this scheme is that programs can be larger than physical memory.
            Virtual memory is the separation of user logical memory from physical memory.

            This separation allows an extremely large virtual memory to be provided for programmers when only a smaller
            physical memory is available.</p>
        <p>Auxiliary memory is much larger in size than main memory but is slower. It normally stores system programs,
            instruction and data files. It is also known as secondary memory. It can also be used as an overflow/virtual
            memory in case the main memory capacity has been exceeded. Secondary memories cannot be accessed directly by
            a processor. First the data/information of auxiliary memory is transferred to the main memory and then that
            information can be accessed by the CPU.</p>
