        <p>Networking, also known as computer networking, is the practice of transporting and exchanging data between
            nodes over a shared medium in an information system. Networking comprises not only the design, construction
            and use of a network, but also the management, maintenance and operation of the network infrastructure,
            software and policies.

            Computer networking enables devices and endpoints to be connected to each other on a local area network
            (LAN) or to a larger network, such as the internet or a private wide area network (WAN). This is an
            essential function for service providers, businesses and consumers worldwide to share resources, use or
            offer services, and communicate. Networking facilitates everything from telephone calls to text messaging to
            streaming video to the internet of things (IoT).

            The level of skill required to operate a network directly correlates to the complexity of a given network.
            For example, a large enterprise may have thousands of nodes and rigorous security requirements, such as
            end-to-end encryption, requiring specialized network administrators to oversee the network.

            At the other end of the spectrum, a layperson may set up and perform basic troubleshooting for a home Wi-Fi
            network with a short instruction manual. Both examples constitute computer networking.</p>
        <img src="images/IMG21.png" alt="Network Photo">
        <p>Types of networking -
            There are two primary types of computer networking: wired networking and wireless networking.

            Wired networking requires the use of a physical medium for transport between nodes. Copper-based Ethernet
            cabling, popular due to its low cost and durability, is commonly used for digital communications in
            businesses and homes. Alternatively, optical fiber is used to transport data over greater distances and at
            faster speeds, but it has several tradeoffs, including higher costs and more fragile components.

            Wireless networking uses radio waves to transport data over the air, enabling devices to be connected to a
            network without any cabling. Wireless LANs are the most well-known and widely deployed form of wireless
            networking. Alternatives include microwave, satellite, cellular and Bluetooth, among others.

            As a general rule, wired networking offers greater speed, reliability and security compared to wireless
            networks; wireless networking tends to provide more flexibility, mobility and scalability.

            It should be noted that these types of networking concern the physical layer of the network. Networking can
            also be classified according to how it's built and designed, encompassing approaches that include
            software-defined networking (SDN) or overlay networks. Networking can also be categorized by environment and
            scale, such as LAN, campus, WAN, data center networks or storage area networks.</p>
        <p>Network Devices: Network devices, also known as networking hardware, are physical devices that allow hardware
            on a computer network to communicate and interact with one another. For example Repeater, Hub, Bridge,
            Switch, Routers, Gateway, Brouter, and NIC, etc.</p>
        <p>1. Repeater - A repeater operates at the physical layer. Its job is to regenerate the signal over the same
            network before the signal becomes too weak or corrupted to extend the length to which the signal can be
            transmitted over the same network. An important point to be noted about repeaters is that they do not
            amplify the signal. When the signal becomes weak, they copy it bit by bit and regenerate it at its star
            topology connectors connecting if original strength. It is a 2-port device.</p>
        <p>2. Hub - A hub is a basically multi-port repeater. A hub connects multiple wires coming from different
            branches, for example, the connector in star topology which connects different stations. Hubs cannot filter
            data, so data packets are sent to all connected devices. In other words, the collision domain of all hosts
            connected through Hub remains one. Also, they do not have the intelligence to find out the best path for
            data packets which leads to inefficiencies and wastage. Active Hub:- These are the hubs that have their
            power supply and can clean, boost, and relay the signal along with the network. It serves both as a repeater
            as well as a wiring center. These are used to extend the maximum distance between nodes.
            Passive Hub:- These are the hubs that collect wiring from nodes and power supply from the active hub. These
            hubs relay signals onto the network without cleaning and boosting them and can’t be used to extend the
            distance between nodes.
            Intelligent Hub:- It works like an active hub and includes remote management capabilities. They also provide
            flexible data rates to network devices. It also enables an administrator to monitor the traffic passing
            through the hub and to configure each port in the hub.</p>
        <p>3. Bridge - A bridge operates at the data link layer. A bridge is a repeater, with add on the functionality
            of filtering content by reading the MAC addresses of the source and destination. It is also used for
            interconnecting two LANs working on the same protocol. It has a single input and single output port, thus
            making it a 2 port device.

            Types of Bridges

            Transparent Bridges:- These are the bridge in which the stations are completely unaware of the bridge’s
            existence i.e. whether or not a bridge is added or deleted from the network, reconfiguration of the stations
            is unnecessary. These bridges make use of two processes i.e. bridge forwarding and bridge learning.
            Source Routing Bridges:- In these bridges, routing operation is performed by the source station and the
            frame specifies which route to follow. The host can discover the frame by sending a special frame called the
            discovery frame, which spreads through the entire network using all possible paths to the destination.</p>
        <p>4. Switch - A switch is a multiport bridge with a buffer and a design that can boost its efficiency(a large
            number of ports imply less traffic) and performance. A switch is a data link layer device. The switch can
            perform error checking before forwarding data, which makes it very efficient as it does not forward packets
            that have errors and forward good packets selectively to the correct port only. In other words, the switch
            divides the collision domain of hosts, but the broadcast domain remains the same.</p>
        <p>5. Routers - A router is a device like a switch that routes data packets based on their IP addresses. The
            router is mainly a Network Layer device. Routers normally connect LANs and WANs and have a dynamically
            updating routing table based on which they make decisions on routing the data packets. The router divides
            the broadcast domains of hosts connected through it.</p>
        <p>6. Gateway A gateway, as the name suggests, is a passage to connect two networks that may work upon different
            networking models. They work as messenger agents that take data from one system, interpret it, and transfer
            it to another system. Gateways are also called protocol converters and can operate at any network layer.
            Gateways are generally more complex than switches or routers. A gateway is also called a protocol converter.
        </p>
        <p>7. Brouter - It is also known as the bridging router is a device that combines features of both bridge and
            router. It can work either at the data link layer or a network layer. Working as a router, it is capable of
            routing packets across networks and working as the bridge, it is capable of filtering local area network
            traffic.</p>
        <p>8. NIC - NIC or network interface card is a network adapter that is used to connect the computer to the
            network. It is installed in the computer to establish a LAN. It has a unique id that is written on the chip,
            and it has a connector to connect the cable to it. The cable acts as an interface between the computer and
            the router or modem. NIC card is a layer 2 device which means that it works on both the physical and data
            link layers of the network model.</p>
        <p>A computer network is a group of computers connected with each other through a transmission medium such as
            cable, wire etc. There are mainly three types of computer networks based on their size:
            1. Local Area Network (LAN)
            2. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
            3. Wide area network (WAN)</p>
        <p>1. Local Area Network (LAN) -
            1. Local area network is a group of computers connected with each other in a small places such as school,
            hospital, apartment etc.
            2. LAN is secure because there is no outside connection with the local area network thus the data which is
            shared is safe on the local area network and can't be accessed outside.
            3. LAN due to their small size are considerably faster, their speed can range anywhere from 100 to 100Mbps.
            4. LANs are not limited to wire connection, there is a new evolution to the LANs that allows local area
            network to work on a wireless connection.</p>
        <p>2. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) -
            MAN network covers larger area by connections LANs to a larger network of computers. In Metropolitan area
            network various Local area networks are connected with each other through telephone lines. The size of the
            Metropolitan area network is larger than LANs and smaller than WANs(wide area networks), a MANs covers the
            larger area of a city or town.</p>
        <p>3. Wide area network (WAN) -
            Wide area network provides long distance transmission of data. The size of the WAN is larger than LAN and
            MAN. A WAN can cover country, continent or even a whole world. Internet connection is an example of WAN.
            Other examples of WAN are mobile broadband connections such as 3G, 4G etc.

            Advantages of WAN:
            Centralized infrastructure: One of the main advantage of WAN is the that we do not need to maintain the
            backup and store data on local system as everything is stored online on a data centre, from where we can
            access the data through WAN.

            Privacy: We can setup the WAN in such a way that it encrypts the data that we share online that way the data
            is secure and minimises the risk of unauthorized access.

            Increased Bandwidth: With the WAN we get to choose the bandwidth based on the need, a large organization can
            have larger bandwidth that can carry large amount of data faster and efficiently.

            Area: A WAN can cover a large area or even a whole world though internet connection thus we can connect with
            the person in another country through WAN which is not possible is other type of computer networks.

            Disadvantages of WAN:
            Antivirus: Since our systems are connected with the large amount of systems, there is possibility that we
            may unknowingly download the virus that can affect our system and become threat to our privacy and may lead
            to data loss.
            Expensive: Cost of installation is very high.
            Issue resolution: Issue resolution takes time as the WAN covers large area, it is really difficult to pin
            point the exact location where the issues raised and causing the problem.

            Interconnection of Networks:
            We have read LAN, MAN and WAN above, we also talked about internet. You can say that an internet is a
            combination of LAN, MAN and WAN.</p>
        <img src="images/IMG22.png" alt="Network Photo">
        <p>Geometric representation of how the computers are connected to each other is known as topology. There are
            eight types of topology - Mesh, Star, Bus, Ring, Hybrid, Tree, P2P and Daisy chain.</p>
        <p>In mesh topology each device is connected to every other device on the network through a dedicated
            point-to-point link. When we say dedicated it means that the link only carries data for the two connected
            devices only. Lets say we have n devices in the network then each device must be connected with (n-1)
            devices of the network. Number of links in a mesh topology of n devices would be n(n-1)/2.

            There are two types of Mesh topology:

            Full Mesh Topology: In this topology each device is connected to all the devices available on the network.
            Partial Mesh Topology: In partial mesh topology, each device is connected to only those devices, to which
            they communicate frequently. This reduces redundant links and saves the setup cost.</p>
        <p>In star topology each device in the network is connected to a central device called hub. Unlike Mesh
            topology, star topology doesn't allow direct communication between devices, a device must have to
            communicate through hub.

            If one device wants to send data to other device, it has to first send the data to hub and then the hub
            transmit that data to the designated device.

            The central device is known as hub and other devices connected to hub are called clients. Generally Coaxial
            cable or RJ-45 cables are used to connect the clients to the hub.</p>
        <p>In bus topology there is a main cable and all the devices are connected to this main cable through drop
            lines. There is a device called tap that connects the drop line to the main cable. Since all the data is
            transmitted over the main cable, there is a limit of drop lines and the distance a main cable can have.

            The main cable that is connected to the devices on the network using drop line is called backbone cable.
            The main cable broadcast the message to all the devices connected to it.
            When a device wants to sends a message, it transmits the message to the backbone cable. All the other
            devices connected to the backbone cable receives the message whether they are intended to receive the
            message or not.
            The most common access method of the bus topologies is CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access). This method is
            used to prevent the collision of data as two or more devices can send the data to main cable at the same
            time.
            CSMA: This method is developed to decrease the chance of collisions when two or more devices starts sending
            the signal at the same time.

            CSMA CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection): In this method, a device monitors the
            transmission medium after it sends the data to see if the transmission was successful. If successful, the
            device marks the communication successful else it sends the data again.
            CSMA CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance): This method tries to prevent the collision
            from happening. In this method, before sending the data, the device checks the transmission medium to see if
            it is busy or not. If busy, then the sender device waits until the transmission medium becomes idle.</p>
        <p>In ring topology each device is connected with the two devices on either side of it. There are two dedicated
            point to point links a device has with the devices on the either side of it. This structure forms a ring
            thus it is known as ring topology.

            If a device wants to send data to another device then it sends the data in one direction, each device in
            ring topology has a repeater, if the received data is intended for other device then repeater forwards this
            data until the intended device receives it.

            Data flow is unidirectional in ring topology.
            This topology doesn't have any end points as nodes are connected in circular fashion.
            The data transfers in ring topology in clockwise direction.
            The popular access method used in ring topology is token passing method. The word token describes segment of
            data send through the network. There are multiple tokens available on the network, the device that
            successfully acquires the token attaches the data to the token. The device that successfully decodes the
            token, receives the data.</p>
        <p>A combination of two or more topology is known as hybrid topology. For example a combination of star and bus
            topology is known as star bus hybrid topology, this topology is shown in the above diagram.</p>
        <p>Tree topology is an example of hybrid topology as it is a combination of star topology and bus topology that
            forms a tree like structure.
            The devices are connected to each other in hierarchical manner. Each node has arbitrary number of child
            nodes. The device at the top of the hierarchy is known as root node and other devices that are lower in
            hierarchy known as descendants of the root node.
            There is a single path between two devices and this is the path of the communication between devices.
            Tree topology is also called star-bus topology.</p>
        <p>In Peer to Peer topology, two devices are connected to each other directly. There is no client and server in
            P2P topology as both the devices serve the purpose of client and server both. Torrent is an example of P2P
            topology as one computer can download the data as well as upload the data to another computer. In P2P, these
            two devices can be two computers, routers, switches etc. The client is the computer that requests the data
            and server is the computer that serves the request by sending data. In P2P, both the devices can request as
            well as send the data.</p>
        <p>In Daisy Chain Topology, all devices are connected in a linear fashion. Consider it as a ring topology where
            the last device is not connected to the first device. Every device in the daisy chain network is connected
            to immediate left and right neighbour devices, except the first and last device.

            The intermediate device helps in propagating the signal by relaying it until it reaches the destination.
            Consider ring topology as an advanced version of this topology, by joining first and last devices in this
            topology a ring topology can be formed.</p>
        <img src="images/IMG23.jpg" alt="Network Photo">
        <p>OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. It has been developed by ISO - 'International Organization for
            Standardization', in the year 1984. It is a 7 layer architecture with each layer having specific
            functionality to perform. All these 7 layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from one person to
            another across the globe.</p>
        <p>1. Physical Layer (Layer 1) :
            The lowest layer of the OSI reference model is the physical layer. It is responsible for the actual physical
            connection between the devices. The physical layer contains information in the form of bits. It is
            responsible for transmitting individual bits from one node to the next. When receiving data, this layer will
            get the signal received and convert it into 0s and 1s and send them to the Data Link layer, which will put
            the frame back together. The functions of the physical layer are as follows:

            Bit synchronization: The physical layer provides the synchronization of the bits by providing a clock. This
            clock controls both sender and receiver thus providing synchronization at bit level.
            Bit rate control: The Physical layer also defines the transmission rate i.e. the number of bits sent per
            second.
            Physical topologies: Physical layer specifies the way in which the different, devices/nodes are arranged in
            a network i.e. bus, star, or mesh topology.
            Transmission mode: Physical layer also defines the way in which the data flows between the two connected
            devices. The various transmission modes possible are Simplex, half-duplex and full-duplex.</p>
        <p>2. Data Link Layer (DLL) (Layer 2) :
            The data link layer is responsible for the node-to-node delivery of the message. The main function of this
            layer is to make sure data transfer is error-free from one node to another, over the physical layer. When a
            packet arrives in a network, it is the responsibility of DLL to transmit it to the Host using its MAC
            address.
            Data Link Layer is divided into two sublayers:

            Logical Link Control (LLC)
            Media Access Control (MAC)
            The packet received from the Network layer is further divided into frames depending on the frame size of
            NIC(Network Interface Card). DLL also encapsulates Sender and Receiver’s MAC address in the header.

            The Receiver's MAC address is obtained by placing an ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) request onto the wire
            asking “Who has that IP address?” and the destination host will reply with its MAC address. The functions of
            the Data Link layer are :

            Framing: Framing is a function of the data link layer. It provides a way for a sender to transmit a set of
            bits that are meaningful to the receiver. This can be accomplished by attaching special bit patterns to the
            beginning and end of the frame.
            Physical addressing: After creating frames, the Data link layer adds physical addresses (MAC address) of the
            sender and/or receiver in the header of each frame.
            Error control: Data link layer provides the mechanism of error control in which it detects and retransmits
            damaged or lost frames.
            Flow Control: The data rate must be constant on both sides else the data may get corrupted thus, flow
            control coordinates the amount of data that can be sent before receiving acknowledgement.
            Access control: When a single communication channel is shared by multiple devices, the MAC sub-layer of the
            data link layer helps to determine which device has control over the channel at a given time.</p>
        <p>3. Network Layer (Layer 3) :
            The network layer works for the transmission of data from one host to the other located in different
            networks. It also takes care of packet routing i.e. selection of the shortest path to transmit the packet,
            from the number of routes available. The sender & receiver's IP addresses are placed in the header by the
            network layer.

            The functions of the Network layer are : Routing: The network layer protocols determine which route is
            suitable from source to destination. This function of the network layer is known as routing.
            Logical Addressing: In order to identify each device on internetwork uniquely, the network layer defines an
            addressing scheme. The sender & receiver's IP addresses are placed in the header by the network layer. Such
            an address distinguishes each device uniquely and universally.</p>
        <p>4. Transport Layer (Layer 4) :
            The transport layer provides services to the application layer and takes services from the network layer.
            The data in the transport layer is referred to as Segments. It is responsible for the End to End Delivery of
            the complete message. The transport layer also provides the acknowledgement of the successful data
            transmission and re-transmits the data if an error is found.

            At sender's side: Transport layer receives the formatted data from the upper layers, performs Segmentation,
            and also implements Flow & Error control to ensure proper data transmission. It also adds Source and
            Destination port numbers in its header and forwards the segmented data to the Network Layer.</p>
        <p>5. Session Layer (Layer 5) :
            This layer is responsible for the establishment of connection, maintenance of sessions, authentication, and
            also ensures security.
            The functions of the session layer are :

            Session establishment, maintenance, and termination: The layer allows the two processes to establish, use
            and terminate a connection.
            Synchronization: This layer allows a process to add checkpoints which are considered synchronization points
            into the data. These synchronization points help to identify the error so that the data is re-synchronized
            properly, and ends of the messages are not cut prematurely and data loss is avoided.
            Dialog Controller: The session layer allows two systems to start communication with each other in
            half-duplex or full-duplex.</p>
        <p>6. Presentation Layer (Layer 6):
            The presentation layer is also called the Translation layer. The data from the application layer is
            extracted here and manipulated as per the required format to transmit over the network.
            The functions of the presentation layer are :

            Translation: For example, ASCII to EBCDIC.
            Encryption/ Decryption: Data encryption translates the data into another form or code. The encrypted data is
            known as the ciphertext and the decrypted data is known as plain text. A key value is used for encrypting as
            well as decrypting data.
            Compression: Reduces the number of bits that need to be transmitted on the network.</p>
        <p>7. Application Layer (Layer 7) :
            At the very top of the OSI Reference Model stack of layers, we find the Application layer which is
            implemented by the network applications. These applications produce the data, which has to be transferred
            over the network. This layer also serves as a window for the application services to access the network and
            for displaying the received information to the user.

            Example: Application - Browsers, Skype Messenger, etc. The functions of the Application layer are :

            Network Virtual Terminal,
            FTAM-File transfer access and management,
            Mail Services,
            Directory Services.</p>
        <p>NTP (network time protocol) is a protocol for clock synchronization in computer systems described in RFC 958.
            It is based on the connectionless UDP protocol (port 123) and belongs to the internet protocol family. For
            the synchronization process, NTP relies on coordinated universal time (UTC), which is obtained from the
            individual clients and servers in a hierarchical system.</p>
        <p>DNS is a directory of names that correspond to specific IP addresses, however it is not a single directory.
            Just like the Internet, the DNS is also You can think of DNS as the contact list on your smartphone, where
            each contact corresponds to a particular mobile number.

            DHCP is a network management protocol that automates the process of configuring the devices on IP networks,
            thus allowing them to use the various network services. A DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and
            other network configuration parameters to each device on a network so that they can communicate with other
            IP networks.</p>
        <p>SSH or Secure SHell is now only major protocol to access the network devices and servers over the internet.
            SSH was developed by SSH Communications Security Ltd., it is a program to log into another computer over a
            network, to execute commands in a remote machine, and to move files from one machine to another. Telnet is
            the joint abbreviation of Telecommunications and Networks and it is a networking protocol best known for
            UNIX platform. Telnet uses the port 23 and it was designed specifically for local area networks.</p>
        <img src="images/IMG24.jpg" alt="Network Photo">
        <p>DHCP protocol (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is commonly used in networks for dynamic IP addressing
            configuration. Every user's device needs at least an IP address to join the network and connect to services.
            When the computer first connects to a local network with cable or WiFi SSID, first thing is to look for the
            IP address, netmask, default gateway and DNS servers.</p>
        <p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is one of the foundations of the internet, working in the background to match
            the names of web sites that people type into a search box with the corresponding IP address, a long string
            of numbers that no one could be expected to remember.

            It's still possible for someone to type an IP address into a browser to reach a website, but most people
            want an internet address to consist of easy-to-remember words, called domain names. (For example, Network
            World.) When your computer wants to find the IP address associated with a domain name, it first makes its
            DNS query via a DNS client, typically in a Web browser. The query then goes to a recursive DNS server, also
            known as a recursive resolver. A recursive resolver is typically operated by an Internet Service Providers
            (ISP), such as AT&T or Verizon (or some other third-party), and it knows which other DNS servers it needs to
            ask to resolve the name of a site with its IP address. The servers that actually have the needed information
            are called authoritative name servers.

            DNS is organized in a hierarchy. An initial DNS query for an IP address is made to a recursive resolver.
            This search first leads to a root server, which has information on top-level domains (.com, .net, .org), as
            well as country domains. Root servers are located all around the world, so the DNS system routes the request
            to the closest one.</p>
        <p>A directory service is a database for storing and maintaining information about users and resources.
            Directory Services are often referred to as directories, user stores, Identity Stores, or LDAP Directory,
            and they store information such as usernames, passwords, user preferences, information about devices, and
            more. Network and system administrators use directory services to onboard users, manage access privileges
            and monitor and control access to applications and infrastructure resources. For example, when a user
            accesses an application, that application will reference the directory service to ensure the user is
            legitimate and has the proper privileges to access and use that application.

            Directory services are fundamental elements of an Identity Security strategy. Many identity and access
            management (IAM) solutions use directory services in conjunction with single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor
            authentication (MFA) or identity lifecycle management functionality.</p>
        <p>The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard
            application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an
            Internet Protocol (IP) network.[1] Directory services play an important role in developing intranet and
            Internet applications by allowing the sharing of information about users, systems, networks, services, and
            applications throughout the network.[2] As examples, directory services may provide any organized set of
            records, often with a hierarchical structure, such as a corporate email directory. Similarly, a telephone
            directory is a list of subscribers with an address and a phone number.</p>
        <p>E-mail System:
            E-mail system comprises of the following three components:

            Mailer,

            Mail Server,

            Mailbox

            Mailer:
            It is also called mail program, mail application or mail client. It allows us to manage, read and compose
            e-mail.

            Mail Server:
            The function of mail server is to receive, store and deliver the email. It is must for mail servers to be
            Running all the time because if it crashes or is down, email can be lost.

            Mailboxes:
            Mailbox is generally a folder that contains emails and information about them.

            Working of E-mail:
            Email working follows the client server approach. In this client is the mailer i.e. the mail application or
            mail program and server is a device that manages emails.

            Following example will take you through the basic steps involved in sending and receiving emails and will
            give you a better understanding of working of email system:

            Suppose person A wants to send an email message to person B.

            Person A composes the messages using a mailer program i.e. mail client and then select Send option.

            The message is routed to Simple Mail Transfer Protocol to person B's mail server.

            The mail server stores the email message on disk in an area designated for person B.</p>
        <p>Working of email: Email messages are composed using an email program (an email client).
            The email program assembles the email by combining the message content (the body) with the recipient,
            subject, date, and time (the header).
            Email relies on a set of protocols to arrive at the correct destination.
            The email program (the email client) comes in two forms, a web-based version like Gmail, where users must
            log in through their browser to access their emails, or a client-based version such as Outlook, where users
            install software to access emails from their local computer.</p>
        <p>Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) is an API for Microsoft Windows which allows programs to
            become email-aware. While MAPI is designed to be independent of the protocol, it is usually used to
            communicate with Microsoft Exchange Server.</p>
        <p>A proxy server acts as a gateway between you and the internet. It’s an intermediary server separating end
            users from the websites they browse. Proxy servers provide varying levels of functionality, security, and
            privacy depending on your use case, needs, or company policy.

            If you're using a proxy server, internet traffic flows through the proxy server on its way to the address
            you requested. The request then comes back through that same proxy server (there are exceptions to this
            rule), and then the proxy server forwards the data received from the website to you.</p>
        <p>Every computer on the internet needs to have a unique Internet Protocol (IP) Address. Think of this IP
            address as your computer's street address. Just as the post office knows to deliver your mail to your street
            address, the internet knows how to send the correct data to the correct computer by the IP address.

            A proxy server is basically a computer on the internet with its own IP address that your computer knows.
            When you send a web request, your request goes to the proxy server first. The proxy server then makes your
            web request on your behalf, collects the response from the web server, and forwards you the web page data so
            you can see the page in your browser.

            When the proxy server forwards your web requests, it can make changes to the data you send and still get you
            the information that you expect to see. A proxy server can change your IP address, so the web server doesn't
            know exactly where you are in the world. It can encrypt your data, so your data is unreadable in transit.
            And lastly, a proxy server can block access to certain web pages, based on IP address.</p>
        <p>Web service is a standardized medium to propagate communication between the client and server applications on
            the WWW (World Wide Web). A web service is a software module that is designed to perform a certain set of
            tasks. The main component of a web service design is the data which is transferred between the client and
            the server, and that is XML. XML (Extensible markup language) is a counterpart to HTML and easy to
            understand the intermediate language that is understood by many programming languages.

            So when applications talk to each other, they actually talk in XML. This provides a common platform for
            application developed in various programming languages to talk to each other.

            Web services use something known as SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) for sending the XML data between
            applications. The data is sent over normal HTTP. The data which is sent from the web service to the
            application is called a SOAP message. The SOAP message is nothing but an XML document. Since the document is
            written in XML, the client application calling the web service can be written in any programming language.
